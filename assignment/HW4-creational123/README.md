# Question Instructions

In this homework assignment, you will apply one or more Structural
patterns discussed in the lectures.
This is a group assignment that requires two students per group.
For each question:

1. Give the name of the design pattern(s) you are applying to the problem.
2. Present your reasons why this pattern will solve the problem. Please be specific to the
   problem and do not give general applicability statements. If there is an alternative
   pattern, explain why you preferred this one..
3. Show you design with a UML class diagram. If the pattern collaborations would be more
   visible with another diagram (e.g. sequence diagram), give that diagram as well.
   (a) Your diagram should show every participant in the pattern including the pattern
   related methods.
   (b) In pattern related classes, give the member (method and attribute) names that
   play a role in the pattern and effected by the pattern. Optionally, include the
   member names mentioned in the question. You are encouraged to omit the other
   methods and fields.
   (c) For the non-pattern related classes, you are not expected to give detailed class
   names etc. You may give a high-level component, like “UserInterface” or
   “DBManagement”
4. Give Java or C++ code for your design showing how you have implemented the pattern.
   (a) Pattern related methods and attributes should appear in the code
   (b) Client usage of the pattern should appear in the code
   (c) Non-pattern related parts of the methods could be a simple print. (e.g.
   ”System.out.println()”, ”cout”)
5. Explain how this design solves the problem.
6. Evaluate your design with respect to SOLID principles. Each principle should be
   addressed, if a principle is not applicable to the current pattern, say so.
