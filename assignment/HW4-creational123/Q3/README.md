We have implemented an inventory system for books. When a book enters the in-
ventory, a book instance is created. Then, the system takes care of the visualizations, reporting,
and all kinds of inventory management tasks regardless of how a book is represented.
The inventory management system is quite lightweight. The customers are very satisfied with
the functionalities of our inventory management system, so we want to broaden our customer
base. We want to repurpose the system for other kinds of small products, like vinyl records or
plush toys, in the future for different businesses.
This is a common strategy in business and technology, where existing resources or systems are
repurposed to meet new needs or opportunities. We will sell our software as a vinyl inventory
system to one customer, as a book inventory system to another. (similar to all the clicker
games like crab wars, idle miner, adventure capitalist etc.)
Which creational pattern can help us for this purpose? Show how to customize it as a vinyl
inventory. (Please do not use if-then-else or switch to select the product type.)
