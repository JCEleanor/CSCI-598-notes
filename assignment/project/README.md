Brainstorm with these questions:

## Domain Interests

What excites you? Examples: For gamers, model a strategy game with dynamic rules; for educators, build a customizable quiz system; for hobbyists, simulate a recipe builder with variations. Maybe a game with swappable rules (Strategy), a drawing app with undo/redo (Command), or a plugin-based text editor (Decorator).

## Functionality to Model

Think about interactions like user inputs, state changes, or extensions. Examples: Real-time notifications (Observer), customizable behaviors (Strategy), or hierarchical structures (Composite). For UI projects, consider MVC to separate concerns.

## Design Challenges

Target issues like complex object initialization (Builder), adapting incompatible interfaces (Adapter), or encapsulating actions for undo (Command).
