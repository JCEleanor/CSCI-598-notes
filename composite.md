### composite
- composite is delegating job to its children (like manager delegates job to their employees)
- EX: 
    - DOM
    - nested React components
    - nested directory strucutre 
    - menu, sub menu...
- in composite pattern, if you change the interface of a composite (parents), have to make sure all kids work with this added feature. (?)
